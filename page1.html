        I sometimes wonder if everyone has their own &#34;comfort object&#34;. For me, it&#39;s this pillow.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That&#39;s
        right. It&#39;s just an object, but when you hug it, it&#39;s as if the whole world goes quiet.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Sometimes
        I feel like it understands me. If I&#39;m not sleeping well, feeling sad or confused, I find that the moment I
        touch it, I start to feel better.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This sounds a bit magical, but I like this
        trick. Even when everything else changes, it stays the same.

      <p class="yes-i-understand">
        <br />Yes, I understand what you mean. Mine has got old and a bit yellow, but I don&#39;t want to replace it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Perhaps
        that&#39;s just a small act of kindness we show ourselves. It reminds me of the toy we used to hold onto when we
        couldn&#39;t sleep as children, but now, as adults, it has taken on a different form.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That&#39;s
        the sense of something being familiar. It remembers your warmth, your tears, and all those nights when you
        didn&#39;t say anything.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Maybe everyone needs something like this. It
        doesn&#39;t speak, it doesn&#39;t offer answers—it just quietly exists, letting you feel... you&#39;re still
        wrapped in some kind of tenderness.
